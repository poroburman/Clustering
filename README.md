# Clustering

This repository consists of different projects using various clustering models to analyze datasets.   

1. Hierarchial_Clustering: The purpose of this project is to use hierarchial clustering find a pattern amongst the customers visiting a Mall. 
                            The dataset used in this project consists of customers data collected by a Mall. Each row consists of a customer.   
                            Each column consists of a customer's variable, including his/her spending score.The files part of this project are:      
                            - Hierarchial_Clustering.ipynb: python script for this analysis.    
                            - Hierarchial_Clustering.Rmd: Rmd script for this analysis.    
                            - Hierarchial_Clustering.pdf: Rmd generated pdf file for this analysis.    
                            - Mall_Customers.csv: dataset used in this project.     

1. K-Means_Clustering: The purpose of this project is to use K-Means Clustering find a pattern amongst the customers visiting a Mall. The dataset   
                        used in this project consists of customers data collected by a Mall. Each row consists of a customer. Each column consists    
                        of a customer's variable, including his/her spending score.The files part of this project are:    
                        - K-Means_Clustering.ipynb: python script for this analysis.   
                        - K-Means_Clustering.Rmd: Rmd script for this analysis.   
                        - k_Means_Clustering.pdf: Rmd generated pdf file for this analysis.   
                        - Mall_Customers.csv: dataset used in this project.
